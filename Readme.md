# About us

This is a  news website that scrapes news articles and generates humorous headlines. 
The website will feature a daily email subscription service, social media sharing capabilities, and an admin panel for managing and editing generated headlines. 
Additionally, the platform will include functionality for training a machine learning model based on user interactions with the jokes. 
The implementation will utilize Python for backend processing and Next.js for the frontend interface.
